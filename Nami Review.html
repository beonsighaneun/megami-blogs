<h1>A Navigator's Log Pose </h1>
<h2><i>Nami's journey to make a map of the world</i></h2>
<p> Decided to spin it up a little bit and bring
up and talk about my favorite character from an anime <br>
that formed my childhood, Nami. Nami is the strong female character that resonated 
with me <br> despite not going through the same things she had to go through (thankfully) </p>
